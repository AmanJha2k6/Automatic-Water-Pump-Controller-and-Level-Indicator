The Automatic Water Pump Controller and Level Indicator is a smart water management system designed using Tinkercad. It automatically controls the water pump based on tank water levels, preventing overflow and dry-run conditions. The system utilizes water level sensors to detect water levels and an Arduino microcontroller to process signals and operate the pump accordingly. An LED or LCD display provides real-time level indication. This project enhances water efficiency, reduces manual intervention, and ensures optimal pump operation, making it ideal for home and industrial applications.
